# Considering Bias in Data

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. We consider articles on political figures from different countries which is combined with a dataset of the country populations, and use a dataset created from calling the API for a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article. We then perform an analysis of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies among countries.

## Data Source

The politicians dataset was generated by crawling the [The Wikipedia Category:Politicians by nationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Politicians_by_nationality).
The population dataset is drawn from [the world population data sheet](https://www.prb.org/international/indicator/population/table/) published by the Population Reference Bureau.
The revision id for each article is required to generate the quality scores and these have been brought in from [Mediawiki Action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Info)

The scores for each article are generated by using [ORES](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES), which is a web service and API that provides machine learning as a service.

## File Descriptions

**data** : 

- *articles_no_revId.txt* : This file is generated in the DataAcquisitionAndAnalysis.ipnyb notebook and contains the list of articles that did not return a revisionId, these articles have been removed from further analysis.
- *wp_countries-no_match.txt* : This file is generated in the DataAcquisitionAndAnalysis.ipnyb notebook and contains the list of countries from the politicians dataset that do not have the corresponding values in the population dataset (Korean) or countries in the populations dataset that did not have any articles in the politicians dataset.
- *wp_politicians_by_country.csv* : This file is generated in the DataAcquisitionAndAnalysis.ipnyb notebook and contains politician, population, revision id and article quality information.

## Research Implications
1. What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it),
and why?

    I expected the western world countries to have a higher number of well written articles (article ORES score is 'GA' or 'FA'). Because we are getting the data from English Wikipedia, we can expect it to be biased to english speaking countries. English speakers would be less acquainted with politicians from non-english speaking countries and hence, we can expect less information/edits for the politicians from those countries. I also expected to see bias due to population - countries with a larger population could have higher quality articles for their politicians but since we are considering per capita values for the ranking, this bias should be mitigated.

2. What (potential) sources of bias did you discover in the course of your data
processing and analysis?

    We see that the bottom 10 country list by both total coverage and high quality article coverage consists of all non-english speaking countries, this could indicate a high language bias.
    We also find that the top 10 country list generally consists of countries with really low populations (mean for population is around 38 million and all the values foor population in the top 10 list are below 6 million), this indicates that there is a per capita bias.This is probably not the best way to account for varying population sizes for the countries because we do not see an obvious trend between the number of articles and the population of a country. To account for this, we can calculate the average per capita article coverage for all countries and discount that from the values.
    
3. Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data
(to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business
decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and
limitations of the data?
Let us assume, a research group was trying to find the most relevant and popular politicians in Asia by using this data. Assuming they include the predicted ORES score for the politicians for their ranking - with politicians with higher quality wikipedia articles having a higher rank, their results would be heavily biased as the training model would represent the english-speaking countries far more than other countries. Using this data would generate a very biased ranking as the data used in the training model is representing a different domain  to the domain of data they would be testing on.
